Join us.Job DescriptionDue to the continued growth and expansion of our Nuclear Team in Westlakes Cumbria, we are looking to increase our technical workforce and are seeking to recruit a Graduate Civil-Structural Engineer.We are looking for individuals who can apply their skills independently and to act as part of a team to deliver projects to the benefit of our Clients. Inherently the projects are multi-disciplinary and may be at any stage in the project life cycle.Our projects range from client consultancy support to complete turn-key solutions.This is an exciting time for the Nuclear Team in Westlakes, with an interesting and expanding pipeline of both international and UK based projects.The AECOM Nuclear Structures Team provide multi-disciplinary consultancy to the nuclear industry in both the nuclear new build and decommissioning sectors. In the new build sector, we are providing engineering support to the Developers of the UK\u2019s fleet of new nuclear power stations. In the Decommissioning Sector, which requires considerable new build to enable decommissioning, AECOM provides support to the entire Nuclear Estate, including:Multidisciplinary design support at SellafieldEarly-stage development of the Deep Geological RepositoryDesign and development of waste storage and disposal facilitiesMultidisciplinary design support to defence projectsAn example project is Sellafield Pile 1 Diffuser Demolition. The project scope was to demolish the Diffuser, a 1450 tonne Reinforced Concrete box section, at the top of the 110m high ventilation stack, located in the heart of a congested nuclear facility.AECOM played a significant role as the Lead Designer responsible for developing a safe demolition strategy for this contaminated structure, demonstrating stability at all stages and designing the associated civil and structural works, mechanical, electrical and process engineering, including the design of the 150m high tower crane, the tallest ever on the Sellafield site.The project challenged the Nuclear Industry\u2019s traditional approach for labour intensive, low risk means of demolition, making use of the tower crane to cut and lift large blocks, arguing that the short term increase in risk would lead to a quicker permanent decrease. This unique demolition is currently on-going and will be a very visible demonstration of the work being done to make Sellafield a safer place.Our Nuclear Civil-Structural Graduates are engaged in teams and work with experienced engineers who guide and mentor them during their time at AECOM.

Most of our staff operate forklifts rather than keyboards.But software also plays a huge role in the company.

As the country gradually starts to transition from gas boilers to heat pumps it is exciting to be creating the tools that installers will be using every day to design the renewable energy systems of the future.We have also developed most of the internal systems we use, which simplifies our interactions with customers and allows us to manage our own business efficiently. Having an in-house web development team means we can do all these things with great speed and flexibility. Midsummer is a growing company and there is lots of exciting work to be done!About the roleYou'll be joining a small team, so you'll get early responsibility and the work you do will immediately make a difference. Our office and warehouse work side by side, so you\u2019ll be sharing a dynamic, busy site with the rest of the team.Midsummer has a friendly and dynamic office environment with an emphasis on teamwork, and a shared environmental ethos across the company as a whole. The company provides free veg bags, a cycle to work scheme and a great selection of social activities and sports groups.You'll get the opportunity to work on both front end and back end development projects.We do most of our coding in javascript - as web applications most of the interesting things in Easy PV and Heatpunk happen on the front end in the browser, but we increasingly use node.js as well on the server, replacing older PHP code.We mainly use SQL databases (usually MariaDB) but we're looking at using MongoDB for some applications. We're also looking at moving some of our code that needs to be particularly performant into Rust.We offer a competitive initial salary depending on experience, and the position is based in our offices beside Milton Country Park on the outskirts of Cambridge. In addition to base salary we have a policy of sharing 10% of the profits of the company equally amongst long-term employees. In time this can add very significantly to your basic pay. The role allows 25 days' holiday per year plus bank holidays.Who we're looking forYou\u2019re an excellent problem solver, and you want a career that will make a difference. Disappearing into a large organisation or doing the same thing every day doesn't appeal - you'd like to put your skills to use to make the planet greener as well as earn your keep. You've got a logical and organised approach.We'll be looking for two particular characteristics. The first is the demonstrable ability to think clearly and logically, to break down a problem into manageable chunks and write a solution that not just solves the problem, but that is written well so that the code can be understood and maintained by others.The second characteristic is a passion for good design. Web design is all about the human-computer interface. You need to understand how users interact with our software, and have the ability to develop tools that are not just pleasing to the eye, but that are intuitive, feel natural, and a pleasure to use.The post is particularly suitable for recent graduates or those about to graduate. You don\u2019t need to be versed in any particular programming languages, but we'll expect you to have at least a little coding experience from your degree."

The training induction also includes sessions dealing with important practical aspects of the job such as \u201chow to communicate with clients\u201d, \u201ceffective marketing\u201d, and \u201cthe role of a trainee\u201d. The training programme then continues with weekly sessions devoted to practical training.The trainees work through different tasks of increasing complexity each week, and their work is then assessed by a partner or qualified attorney. Both communal and individual feedback is provided as part of a group discussion. These practical training sessions ensure that all of our new trainees are exposed to the same core practical examples, providing them with the tools to develop their skills together.In total, seven weeks of a new trainee\u2019s first year at Reddie & Grose are spent working through our bespoke training programme. After this, new trainees will be supported through a 13-week course leading to the Certificate in Intellectual Property Law (currently provided by Queen Mary, University of London) and a European qualifying examination preparation course.We want our trainees to haveaccess to the best support they can get, so they are also encouraged to take advantage of courses and lectures provided by the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys.Range of workWe offer services across all key technologies, and have particular strengths in electronics and software, chemistry, mechanical engineering and biotechnology.
